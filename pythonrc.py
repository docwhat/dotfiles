""" ~/.pythonrc.py
PYTHONRC - Really Neat way to make the python shell fun and usable!

Copy this file to $HOME/.pythonrc.py
In windows, copy it to $HOMEDRIVE:$HOMEPATH\.pythonrc.py

This is called when interactive python interpreter is instructed to:
    import user
You can force this to import everytime by setting an environment variable:
    export PYTHONSTARTUP="$HOME/.pythonrc.py"
It makes command history persistent, allows TAB expansion, adds time
stamp.
