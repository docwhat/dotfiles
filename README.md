dotfiles
========

My personal dotfiles (e.g. `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.)

How to use
----------

1.  Install [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm)
2.  `git clone https://github.com/docwhat/dotfiles.git .dotfiles`
3.  `rcup`
4.  `rcup` -- This second run is needed to pick up changes to the `~/.rcrc` file.
