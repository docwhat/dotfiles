We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Tell her she
looks thin. You're going to do his laundry? You know the worst thing
about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let
you go.

Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!
And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. **Aww, it's true.** _I've
been hiding it for so long._ And when we woke up, we had these bodies.

### I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.

Is it a "Bad Thing!"(TM)?

Should we use Rehat on linode? Or maybe macos? Is bluemix an option?

Did you go to the soiree?

Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then
perhaps gifts! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics
lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they
feel. That makes me feel angry!

1.  I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As
    though!
2.  For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!
3.  Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER
    ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.

#### Say what?

That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? That's not soon
enough! Say what? You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Ah,
computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the
phrase "upside your head."

-   They're like sex, except I'm having them!
-   OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the
    way only a woman can.
-   No, she'll probably make me do it.

Kif might! I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. You don't know how
to do any of those. No! Don't jump!

And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.
That's not soon enough! No! I want to live! There are still too many
things I don't own! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.

Kif might! Shut up and get to the point! Oh, I think we should just stay
friends. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? I was having the
most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you
were there!

That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Check it out, y'all. Everyone
who was invited is here. You don't know how to do any of those. I
videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail
them later.

That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Is today's hectic lifestyle
making you tense and impatient? Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!
Pansy. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a
little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you
sexually?

Moving along… This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against
me! Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the
voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.

Hello Morbo, how's the family? Is today's hectic lifestyle making you
tense and impatient? Bender, you risked your life to save me! I am
Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.

No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Dr. Zoidberg,
that doesn't make sense. But, okay! But, like most politicians, he
promised more than he could deliver. Hey, guess what you're accessories
to.

I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything
you ever believed in. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides,
these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom
I killed for their stemcells.

Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only
used to download pornography. And remember, don't do anything that
affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which
case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. No! I want to
live! There are still too many things I don't own! OK, if everyone's
finished being stupid. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Okay, it's
500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the
charge and the reception isn't very…
